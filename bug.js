The issue stems from an asynchronous operation within a Firebase function that doesn't properly handle the promise resolution.  Specifically, the function attempts to update a Firestore document after performing an operation that might fail (e.g., fetching data from another service). If the preceding operation fails, the promise rejects, causing the subsequent Firestore update to be skipped, resulting in unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies. The error isn't explicitly thrown, making it difficult to debug.

```javascript
exports.myFunc = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  try {
    const externalData = await fetchExternalData(); // Might reject
    await admin.firestore().collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').update({ data: externalData });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    // This error handling is insufficient; it doesn't retry or provide feedback
  }
});
```
