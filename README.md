# Firebase Cloud Function Asynchronous Operation Error Handling: Silent Failure in Firestore Update

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Firebase Cloud Functions. The function asynchronously fetches external data and then updates a Firestore document. However, if the external data fetch fails, the Firestore update silently fails without any indication of the problem. This leads to data inconsistencies and makes debugging challenging.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
